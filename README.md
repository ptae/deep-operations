# Deep Operations :+1:

A JavaScript library to work with deep object modifications.

## Why Deep Operations?

Sometimes doing deep object modifications is quite difficult
and not so performatic. Deep Operations gives a collection
of modular functions to work with operations like:

* Deep object merge
* Deep array concatenation
* Deep object differentiation
* And many others

Documentation can be found [here](https://gsseixas.github.io/deep-operations/).

  npm install deep-operations

```
